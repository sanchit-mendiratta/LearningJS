# LearnJS

Here is a list of concepts that I feel are important to learn in Javascript. 
Most of these concepts should be known to developers working on large projects.

- Debouncing & Throttling
- Object comparison
- Memoisation
- Polyfills
  - Bind
  - New
  - Promise
  - Dom QuerySelector Api
- Deep cloning Arrays and Objects
- Design Patterns
