## How to improve Load Time Performance of a webpage ?

- Put stylesheets at the top -- ensure styles are loaded before content is rendered, and want to show content as fast as possible
- Put scripts at the bottom. -- nothing else below a script can load til the script is loaded, and its more important to load content such as images first, before adding interaction capabilities (javascript)
- Make JavaScript and CSS external (don't use inline JS/CSS -- works against caching abilities of browser for JS & CSS files)
- Make fewer HTTP requests.
- Gzip components
- Compress code using Minification and Uglification
- Use Code Splitting - Only Ship the code that is required
